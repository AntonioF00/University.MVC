#### Install the runtime .NET Desktop Runtime
For Windows, there are three .NET runtimes you can install. You should install both the .NET Desktop Runtime and the ASP.NET Core Runtime to ensure that you're compatible with all types of .NET apps.

This runtime includes the base .NET runtime, and supports Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Forms apps that are built with .NET. This isn't the same as .NET Framework, which comes with Windows.
